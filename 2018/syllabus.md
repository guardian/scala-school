Introduction
============

The 2018 session of Scala School will run from October 1st until the
end of December, and will consist of a weekly class (there will be two
instances of this class to allow for two separate groups to study the
material).

The core teaching method is to introduce Scala programming concepts by
slowly building up a working application from scratch, with each week
being devoted to achieving a specific goal for which a set of
predefined Scala concepts will be required.

The application exercise
========================

The exercise that will be studied by the group is to create an
application that will communicate with two simple API endpoints as a
client, combining the information read from these two endpoints, and
then making that aggregated information available via a new API for
which the application itself will act as a server.
